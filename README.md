# EasyChic

EasyChic is taken from the English “easy” and “chic” which is inspired by the concept of an application that we will design with the vision of helping consumers look chic very easily with just one click. In addition, EasyChic aims to support the growth and development of SMEs and make it easier for consumers to buy clothes through the e-commerce business model.
